# ****Treasury DAO Meeting 20/07/2022****



* Last week meeting w Dr. Biyan Mienert -> would be able to support the IOTA community to set up a legal entity for a treasury DAO
    * Many legal wrapper options out there that fill different purposes:
        * Cayman Island foundation is a commonly used one.
            * Offshore often seen as “tax fleeing”
            * Quite expensive setup and running
            * Often needs a local representative in charge of the operation of the DAO. Requires trust and represents a centralization point. May not be aligned with the goals of the community
        * British Virgin islands
            * More corporate and DAO-like structure
            * Not as expensive and complex to set up and run as the Cayman islands
        * Marshall islands
            * Offshore perceived as “tax paradise”
            * Functions in a DAO-like manner
            * Can operate fully on smart contracts
            * Simple and cheap setup
            * Closely related to the US
            * No taxes for non-profit
            * Expensive if a high level of income is generated
        * Swiss association
            * Legit and trusted Swiss legislation
            * Not expensive or time consuming
            * Quick setup
            * Flexibility in terms of non-profit/for profit
            * Limited liability protection for members. Such protection may need to come from another entity \
Possibility: set up a committee represented “on chain” as a GmbH (for corporate structure) under the umbrella of the association. The association makes for example charity possible.
            * Operations and monitoring is possible “on chain”
            * No Swiss national needed
* We should try to make a decision as soon as possible. If we keep postponing, it means that the treasury will operate later and later.
* Would be good to have a specialist (blockchain specialist lawyer) to help us make a decision. Would be good to make a comparison in a table with cost for development, timeline, protection for DAO participants (weak/medium/strong), tax convenience
* Phylo can ask Biyan to make a tailored comparison according to the needs of the IOTA community, highlight the pros and cons
* Once we collect this info and find out how other DAOs are setup, should this be decided in a vote by the community or should the lawyer take the decision?
    * Would be good to get an agreement in the community on this, however based on the professional recommendation from a lawyer
    * Suggestion: Engage with a lawyer, get the recommendation agreed on by the community voters to act on behalf of them
* Would be useful to list some bullet points/questions to get feedback from legal specialists such as Biyan

**Next actions:**



* Åsa to set up [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DtTY1yE44uaNi0MHt4AFPrirR2ALYAwIn2lJ4blMMRM/edit#gid=0) for questions regarding the DAO setup
* Phylo to share spreadsheets with comparisons of different DAOs and their relevance for the treasury DAO in order to collect them in the document mentioned above
* Phylo to ask Biyan to make a tailored comparison according to the needs of the IOTA community, highlight the pros and cons
