<!-- DISCUSSED TOPICS -->
## **Discussed Topics**

### **Firefly voting process, final workflow on Referendums**

- The involved community members described the envisioned process of how referendums will be published in Github.
- After approval from a set of reviewers, the referendum will be merged into the master branch.
- Firefly will use the already existing utility of the IF (Amazon S3 Bucket) to receive new referendums that are merged into the master branch. This way, mostly already existing infrastructure can be used, and not much has to be added or changed in Firefly's software.

- It will be checked if Hornet could utilize the same system.

### **Decisions on naming and Timelines: commencing / holding period**

The Community needs to come to agreements on the following timelines:
- **commencing time** = How long should voting be open before the counting and building up of weight in the "holding period" begins?
     - this is a timeframe defined in milestones. The coordinator issues a milestone every 10 seconds. So one day will be represented by 8640 milestones.

- **holding time** = How long are voters required to keep a voting transaction held on an address to gain 100% weight of the vote? 
    
    - This time is required to conquer attempts of 'vote buying" or "Flash loan attacks." Longer holding periods will reduce the risks of those attacks on the vote

The Community aims to decide how to name several things regarding the referendum object (the .json file uploaded to nodes and Firefly)

- Agreement was found to call it "Voting Question" and "Answer."

### **IOTA Treasury Website functionality**

The Functionality of the envisioned Treasury Website was introduced:
- Displaying of all relevant information that are important for a voter to make an educated decision
- Tutorial and possible video guide of how to vote
- Links to the exact technical specifications of the voting system
- Display of the ongoing Referendum
- Display of "live" Voting Data during the ongoing vote
- Archive of historical Vote Data

The participants agreed on the domain https://iotatreasury.org
This domain is owned by the community member Gman214

### **Community Design and Branding efforts needed for the Website**

If community members would like to become part of the Design and Branding of this Website, they are invited to get in contact or submit ideas in the **#governance-discussion** channel. 
A Team could build up and create a remarkable design for the Community Website.

Members agreed that this Website should go live soon and does not yet need fancy functionality. Important is that a way to inform voters will be provided.



### **Contribute**

**The involved community members want to highlight that the above-discussed topics are all open to discussions for every community member that wants to engage or raise concerns or disagreements about it. Positive feedback and input from the Community on all the above-discussed topics are welcomed. All meetings and calls will happen in the public channels, and members are invited and welcome to join and raise their voices during the sessions. All code and technical solutions used in the Community voting system will always be fully open-sourced and published on GitHub**


#### **The next community call in the Discord is planned for Thursday, 09.09. - at 2 pm GMT**
