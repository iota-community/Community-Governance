## **Discussed Topics**

### **Introduction Adam and Greg BUILDERS of the Treasury System**

- Adam and Greg introduced themselves to the community as they will do the development of the voting tech and the Treasury website
- scope of work will follow these specifications: 
  - https://github.com/iota-community/treasury/blob/main/specifications/treasury-tech-proposal.md
- The EDF will fund the work to create the system for the community

### **Functionality of the Treasury Website**

- The treasury website will include all information a user needs to make an educated decision
- it will explain the whole community process so far
- it will explain exactly how to vote to users in a tutorial style
- it will include an faq
- Tutorial and possible video guide of how to vote
- Links to the exact technical specifications of the voting system
- Display of the ongoing Referendum
- Display of "live" Voting Data during the ongoing vote
- Archive of historical Vote Data
- Users will be able to start the vote directly from this website, so this will be the way for every user to create a vote:
   - go on the website - choose the referendum to vote on
   - connect the website to your firefly wallet
   - choose the option you want to vote on
   - choose the number of votes you want to use for the option
   - to confirm this decision, firefly will open, and the user will confirm the vote within firefly by entering the stronghold password or connecting and executing using the ledger device of the user
- A group of community members has come up with a beautiful design and branding for the treasury website
- They will work closely together with the builder's team to bring the website alive pretty soon
- they will maybe also be able to create an animated tutorial video that explains the voting process

### **Open end community discussions**

Some questions came up again and have been answered bu the community:
- why isn't the vote using a 2/3rd majority to make a valid decision: 
   - it has been discussed in the last months several times and in our community calls, the involved members have agreed to use the simple majority of votes as this is the most commonly used form of establishing a binary decision in human decision making

- will a user be able to use the funds of a seed and do different votes with different opinions?
   - yes, users are free to split funds in different profile wallets. Every wallet can be used to have its own independent vote and opinion.
- Once you vote, can you change your mind? Or once you click your vote, that's it. A vote is made, and tokens are locked?
   - No, users can always change their minds and change an active vote. The tokens are not locked. But if you change the opinion during the holding period, the vote will only gain voting weight for this opinion starting from the time you changed it. Your voting weight from before (from the opponent opinion) will still be counted. You cannot change the past.

- If my tokens are on exchange, can i vote? If not, will we get a vote from exchanges known?
   - No, you cannot vote if your tokens are on an exchange. Voting is only possible for tokens in the Firefly Wallet. Exchanges will not vote with your tokens. They would need to move tokens out of their cold wallets for this. Also, most exchanges have a clear policy not to take part in any governance decisions of projects.


### **Contribute**
