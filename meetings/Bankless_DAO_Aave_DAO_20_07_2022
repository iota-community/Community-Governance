    * KYC for all grants above $20k (no KYC for grants below that amount)
* How are the grants committee people employed? How did they form this?
    * The original Aave DAO seeded and built the Aave Grant DAO. Salaries are public.
* Do you use a project proposal template?
    * A Google forms questionnaire is used to request details and reference of previous work
* Do larger grants require a more thorough application process? 
    * Due diligence needed, a light presentation needed, going through the entire community. The higher up the grant goes, the more complex is the application.
* The company under which the employees are, is there a CEO, does it have an owner?
    * Itâ€™s a DAO, it has no legal structure. A DAO existing in web3. The Aave Grant DAO is a subsidiary of Aave DAO. 
* Are the employees elected by the DAO?
    * Yes
* Formation process: How did Aave come up with the idea of establishing the grant DAO?
    * Need for a grants programme separated from the main DAO. Did not want a whole community voting on everything but rather a smaller expertise group that can make sure proper due diligence is being done etc.
* Are the employees of the DAO full time or part time employed?
    * Mix of full time and hour-based employment
* Who is proposing milestones? The review team or the proposer?
    * Collaboration between both parties
* For how long are the committee members elected and how are they elected?
