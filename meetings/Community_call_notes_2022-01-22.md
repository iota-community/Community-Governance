<!-- DISCUSSED TOPICS -->
## **Discussed Topics**

### 2. **Firefly design / voting UI/UX discussions**

- Details of the voting layout have been discussed. We went through the current wireframes of how voting in Firefly would look. Some final adjustments are on the way from IF UI/UX Team
- The Firefly team will start working on the final implementation of the voting mechanism and the UI/UX from Monday 17th.
- Staking will not be influenced by voting. So whoever is staking already in Firefly can always do any voting functionality independent from the staking mechanism.

After the first vote, further votes can be added as events to Firefly as long as the node that Firefly is connecting is aware of those events (has added it in its database)

### 3. The Treasury website

- We went through the current draft version of the website. 
- The website contains all crucial information for voters regarding the tokens and the vote
- An extensive Tutorial will explain the whole voting process
- A FAQ will answer possible questions
- The technical details of how voting and counting exactly works are displayed.
The website's backend is built by the Soonlabs Team for the community and will host Soonlabs technology to offer voting functionality and live results of the vote. A group of community designers does the design UI/UX.
- A draft version is available [here](https://iota-community.github.io/treasury-web/index.html) - this is not yet final!

### **Open end community discussions**

- some questions about the voting system (token-based) have been coming up, and we explained again why it is currently the only possible and secure method to do this vote.
- Q: do you always vote with all tokens from a wallet? or can you also vote with a part of the tokens from the wallet?
    - The system allows you only to use the total amount of tokens you hold in one wallet under the profile to use. Every wallet in your profile can be chosen independently to participate in the vote. It is even possible to vote with different wallets for different options.

- Q: Isn't it better to publish the results only after the end of the voting period because of the influence of projections on voting results
    - As the vote happens on the Tangle and every vote is a transaction, it is impossible to keep votes "secret." This is why everyone can always see the current live counting at any time in Firefly and on the website, and also every participating node operator can display the results

- Q: How do we get some of the funds into action asap?
    - This topic was also discussed. As it might take time to agree on the final treasury structure, and also it will take time until smart contracts are available on mainnet that can automate governance and secure the treasury tokens, it might be interesting to find an interim solution after the first vote to make a part of the tokens available for the ecosystem quite fast. A smaller portion of the tokens could be made available already so that projects can get initial support already. Ideas around this are explored.
